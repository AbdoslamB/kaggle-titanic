## Kaggle-Titanic

This is a Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster competition from  Kaggle platform. The problem of this competition is to creat model that to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The goal of this repository is to create diffren models to predict the Titanic servivers, then cheking which model do the best proformance in the preduction.

look at the competition in **[kaggle Website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)**.
